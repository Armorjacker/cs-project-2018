     <p>The above picture is the game I created called "Mole Mash".
     I created the app in MIT App Inventor.</p>
     <p>The picture below is the interactive story we wrote in python.
     We managed to write a story about a farmboy who was able to save 
     the village and defeat the cyclops in the end of the story.</p>

     <p>The picture below is a program that Troy and I wrote in python.
       Its called scramble and what happens is you load the game and the game gives
       you a word tats scrambled. If you get it correct then you have to restart the program
       ifyou want to play again. If you guessed wrong then it will say you got it wrong 
       however you could use the hint option which says what letters are in what order.</p>
