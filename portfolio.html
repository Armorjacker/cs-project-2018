       <p>The picture below is a program that Troy and I wrote in python.
       Its called scramble and what happens is you load the game and the game gives
       you a word tats scrambled. If you get it correct then you have to restart the program
       if you want to play again. If you guessed wrong then it will say you got it wrong 
       however you could use the hint option which says what letters are in what order.</p>
